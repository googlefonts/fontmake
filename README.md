# fontmake

`fontmake` compiles fonts from various sources (`.glyphs`, `.ufo`, `designspace`) into binaries (`.otf`, `.ttf`). You can use it to create static instances and variable fonts.

## Installation

Fontmake requires Python 3.7 or later.

Releases are available on [PyPI][] and can be installed with [pip][].

``` bash
pip3 install fontmake
```

Use the `-U`, `--upgrade` option to update fontmake and its dependencies
to the newest available release:

``` bash
pip3 install -U fontmake
```

## Basic Usage

After installation, you will be able to use the `fontmake` executable.

For example, to compile a variable font from a Glyphs source file, use:

``` bash
fontmake -g MyFont.glyphs -o variable
```

The most important command line arguments to the `fontmake` executable are the `-g`/`-u`/`-m` flags, one of which is required and selects the source file format, and the optional `-o` flag, which chooses the output file format.

### Source file format options

* `-g filename.glyphs`: Converts a Glyphs source file to binary.
* `-u filename.ufo ...`: Converts one or more UFO files to binary.
* `-m filename.designspace`: Converts a Designspace file to binary. (The `-m` is for `mutatormath`, an old Python library for handling designspaces.)

### Output file format options

You may provide one or more output file formats after the `-o` option. For example, `-o otf ttf` creates OTF and TTF binary font files for each master in your input file.

The following output file formats are available:

* `otf`: Per-master OTF (CFF-outline) binaries. Placed in the `master_otf/` directory.
* `ttf`: Per-master TTF (TrueType-outline) binaries. Placed in the `master_ttf/` directory.
* `otf-cff2`: Per-master OTF binaries with CFF2 outlines. Placed in the `master_otf/` directory.
* `variable`: A TrueType variable font. Placed in the `variable_ttf/` directory.
* `variable-cff2`: A variable font with CFF2 outlines. Placed in the `variable_otf/` directory.

The following output file formats are also available, but are generally used internally by fontmake as an intermediate step to one of the above outputs:

* `otf-interpolatable`: OTF binaries suitable for merging into a variable font. Placed in the `master_otf_interpolatable/` directory. (These differ from `otf` in that the outlines are unoptimized.)
* `ttf-interpolatable`: TTF binaries suitable for merging into a variable font. Placed in the `master_ttf_interpolatable/` directory. (The outlines are converted to quadratic curves in an interpolation-compatible way.)
* `ufo`: Glyphs sources can be converted to UFO. Placed in the `master_ufo/` directory.

If no format option is specified, the default is `-o otf ttf`.

### Other important command line options

* `-i` (Interpolate instances): Having per-master binaries is not always what you expect; if you have defined instances ("exports") in your Glyphs file, they will *not* be generated by default. To generate them, pass the `-i` flag, which interpolates static instances, and places them in the `instance_ttf/` or `instance_otf/` directory as appropriate.

* `--output-dir <some_directory>`: Places all output in the given directory, instead of the per-format directories mentioned above.

* `--output-path <filename>`: This is only valid if the output is a single binary file, and writes the output to the given filename.

* `-f` (Flatten components): Ensures that any glyphs which contain components which *themselves* contain components are decomposed to a single level. This is recommended as certain rendering environments do not correctly handle nested components - see [this link](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/issues/2961) for more details.

## Advanced Usage

See [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md).

## Troubleshooting

See [`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Developers

Developers can get the latest version of `fontmake` by cloning the git repository:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/googlefonts/fontmake
cd fontmake
pip install .
```

Developers who want to quickly test changes to the source code without re-installing can use the "--editable" option when installing from a local source checkout:

``` bash
pip install -e .
```

It is recommended to install fontmake inside a virtual environment to
prevent conflicts between its dependencies and other modules installed
globally.

You could also use the [pipx][] tool to automate the
installation/upgrade of python apps like fontmake in isolated
environments.
